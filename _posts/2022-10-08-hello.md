# The "hello wolrd" of Jekyll -- My frist personal bolg
---
---
## The reason I want to create a blog:

* For many days, I always trying to get something knowledge of _Ruby_ and _Jekyll_, but I never learn about Linux opreating system and even don't know what *Ruby* is. What enven worse, because my laptop is Apple Macbook Air (M1 Modle), which support *Ruby* badly, I was cheaking many vidoes on the _Youtube_ and the articles on *Stack Over Float*, expendding the hole night to setting the *Ruby* environment, thanks God, finally, worked it out.
* And... after a month later, I occasionally  watch a vido which the _Youtube_ recommended to me, __"Simple step, achieve your personal blog!"__ I must to say, that vido is pretty good and easy to hands on, just a few minutes later, my bolg already have its prototype, and the theme is looked nicely. And then, this blog was implemented.
* One more things that I want to say is that, actually, I didn't learn about anything related to the web development. The things about HTML, JavaScript or .Js. But the GitHub pages is truely easy to use, it just like the black box, you don't need to know how the basic things work, using the interface, all is done. Perfect!
